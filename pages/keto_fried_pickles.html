                <li>Place a small amount of chedder cheese in each opening of the muffin pan, just enough to make a small even layer.</li>
                <li>Place a single pickle in each of the muffin pan openings.</li>
                <li>Place enough chedder cheese on top of the placed pickle to cover it with an even layer.</li>
