            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</li>
                <li>If using frozen spinach, thaw and squeeze to drain first. If using broccoli, place it into a pot of water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 1-2 minutes until bright green.</li>
                <li>Combine the chicken, bacon, drained spinach or broccoli, garlic, ranch dressing, and half of the shredded cheeses in a large bowl. 
                    Stir until well incorporated. Transfer to a 9×13 in (23×33 cm) glass or stoneware casserole dish. (Alternatively, you can mix everything directly in the casserole dish.)
                    <strong>Optional tip</strong>: If you like extra ranch flavor, add 1-3 teaspoons of ranch seasoning mix, in addition to the dressing.</li>
                <li>Top with remaining shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheeses.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 15 minutes, until hot and bubbly.</li>
            </ol>
